// This utility has been deprecated.
// The old mentions system was based on task-only comments.
// Comments are now polymorphic (project/task/delivery) and
// mention parsing is no longer a separate concern.
//
// If mention support is needed in the future, it should be
// implemented as part of the comment creation flow in routes/comments.js.
